# 🍽️ Recipe App

A simple and elegant **React Native** app that lets users browse and view recipes with images. Built using **React Navigation**, image display functionality, and basic in-memory data storage (without persistent storage).

## 🚀 Features

- 📱 **React Navigation** – Smooth transitions between different screens (Home, Details, Add Recipe).
- 🖼️ **Image Display** – Each recipe includes a photo preview.
- 🧠 **In-Memory Data Storage** – Recipes are stored temporarily during app runtime.
- 🗂️ **Recipe List and Detail View** – Easily view recipe details and ingredients.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React Native**
- **React Navigation**
- **Expo (if used)**
- **React Native Image Picker** or similar (for adding images from device)

## 🧪 How It Works

- Start the app and browse the list of available recipes.
- Tap a recipe to view its full details.
- All data is stored in memory — it will reset when the app restarts.
