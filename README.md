# 🍽️ Recipe App

A simple and elegant **React Native** app that lets users browse and view recipes with images. Built using **React Navigation**, image display functionality, and basic in-memory data storage (without persistent storage).

## 🚀 Features

- 📱 **React Navigation** – Smooth transitions between different screens (Home, Details, Add Recipe).
- 🖼️ **Image Display** – Each recipe includes a photo preview.
- 🧠 **In-Memory Data Storage** – Recipes are stored temporarily during app runtime.
- 🗂️ **Recipe List and Detail View** – Easily view recipe details and ingredients.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React Native**
- **React Navigation**
- **Expo (if used)**
- **React Native Image Picker** or similar (for adding images from device)

## 🧪 How It Works

- Start the app and browse the list of available recipes.
- Tap a recipe to view its full details.
- All data is stored in memory — it will reset when the app restarts.

## 🎬 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RecipeApp.git
   cd RecipeApp

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   Run the app:

```bash
      npx expo start
Or use react-native run-android / react-native run-ios if not using Expo.

🔮 Future Enhancements
💾 Add persistent storage (e.g., AsyncStorage or SQLite)

🔍 Search and filter recipes by category or name

✏️ Edit and delete existing recipes

🌐 Sync data with a backend or cloud database
